/**
 * Various useful additions to UIViewController, most notably the ability get more information about the view lifecycle.
 *
 * Remark:
 * -------
 * As written in the UIKit documentation (though slightly scattered all around), view controller's view frame dimensions
 * are only known when -viewWillAppear: gets called, not earlier (this means you should avoid making calculations
 * depending on it in the -viewDidLoad method; the frame is the one you got from the xib, not necessarily the one which
 * will be used after status, navigation bar, etc. have been added, or after some container controller updates the
 * view controller's frame for display).
 *
 * The same is true for rotations: The final frame dimensions are known in -willAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientation:duration:
