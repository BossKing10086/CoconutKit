 * and child connections will be started when the parent connection is started. If the parent connection is already
 * running when the parent - child relationship is established, the child connection will be automatically started
 * (with the same run loop modes as the parent connection)
 *
 * Child connections can be useful to implement cascading requests. Take for example an object which must be filled using
 * two requests. You want the process to happen as if only one connection is actually running. This can be easily achieved
 * using a child connection
 *
 * Note that you are responsible of avoiding cycles when creating parent / child relationships, otherwise the behavior
